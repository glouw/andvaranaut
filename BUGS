[x] Bow sometimes segfaults when hit enemy
    -> Resolved: lootbags were dropping out of map range

[x] Some rooms have two themes.
    -> Resolved: rooms spawning from trapdoors were sometimes randomly chosen twice

[x] Out of bounds heap access: gauge
    -> Resolved: off by one for last

[x] Picked up NULL item?
    -> Resolved: CLASSIFICATIONS and NONE were valid items for xitrand()

[ ] Thought: How is 144hz refresh rate handled?
    -> Needs testing: lock at 60fps since timings require this update speed.
    -> VSYNC should handle this.

[x] Furthest enemy is being attacked.
    -> Sorting was only in one direction for renderer, not in other direction for sprites

[x] Upper case sprites not showing
    -> Size was set to 0.0 in registrar
