Dwarven Brothers

    Hero finds a young dwarf, that is trapped to a corner of the dungeon. Unable to leave due to invisible
    forces, the dwarf asks the hero to send a message to a dwarven outpost in a different part of the
    dungeon as the hero is the first intelligent creature he has seen since he got trapped. The hero finds
    the outpost, where they discover only a single aging dwarf, weak and on the verge of collapse. The
    elderly dwarf reveals that the dwarven brothers Olan and Gunnar of House Steinulf were on a
    pilgrimage a long time ago, and only Olan returned.

    The elderly dwarf writes a reply and asks for the hero to send it back to the imprisoned, saying that
    they will probably never meet again and that he can feel his last breaths. The hero returns to Gunnar,
    and he reads it. The elderly dwarf knew where his brother was, but had been unable to visit him. After
    explaining that he had been trapped in this corner due to snatching a sacred amulet during his
    pilgrimage, the trapped dwarf asks to deliver another letter, this time to his brother Olan’s location,
    which was revealed through the message from the dwarven outpost. The location was in some caverns
    that were hidden through false walls.

    The hero finds the false walls, and though they look real, is able to walk past them without issue. At
    the end of the passage, the hero finds a rotting corpse in simple robes. Sitting in front of the corpse is a
    journal. Assuming it is the younger brother Olan’s, the hero takes it back to Gunnar, and it was found
    that ever since the pilgrimage separated the brothers, the dead brother went into seclusion in
    mourning, regretting that he couldn’t stop his older brother. Saddened, Gunnar asks the hero for one
    last favour: to burn the brother’s body and bring back the ashes in an urn. When the hero returns with
    the ashes, he tells the hero that he could not bear to know that he is completely alone now. Even if he
    does now consider the hero a friend, he does not want to continue living and he destroys the artifact
    in a fit of rage. To his surprise, the trapped dwarf then rapidly ages in front of the hero. Before he
    perishes, the dwarf gives him a token of thanks: a ring passed down by his family for generations that is
    supposed to inspire courage [Ring of Steinulf grants +%5 health]. As the dwarf dies, he asks the hero to
    burn his body as well, and add it to the urn his brother is in.
    If the hero does as requested, the ring gains [+%2 luck].
